MAXSPPROD

You are given an array A containing N integers. The special product of each ith integer in this array is defined as the product of the following:

LeftSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] (i>j). If multiple A[j]â€™s are present in multiple positions, the LeftSpecialValue is the maximum value of j.

RightSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] (j>i). If multiple A[j]s are present in multiple positions, the RightSpecialValue is the minimum value of j.

Write a program to find the maximum special product of any integer in the array.

Input: You will receive array of integers as argument to function.

Return: Maximum special product of any integer in the array modulo 1000000007.

Note: If j does not exist, the LeftSpecialValue and RightSpecialValue are considered to be 0.

Constraints 1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

To get left special value:
	Previous greater element
	 Use a stack, push items replacing stack items which are lesser than current.
	 Mark current item's PGE is Stack top, if stack is empty => -1
	 A: [2,1,4,3]
	 stack: []

	 2,
	 PGE: [-1] (stack is empty)
	 stack: [2]

	 1,
	 PGE: [-1, 2]
	 stack: [1,2]

	 4,
	 replace < 4
	 PGE: [-1, 2, -1]
	 stack: [4]

	 3,
	 replace < 3
	 stack: [3,4]
	 PGE: [-1, 2, -1, 4]


To get right special value:
	Next Greater element
	 Use a non-increasing stack, push items replacing current stack items which are lesser than current
	 Mark NGE of stack items as current element
	 A: [2,1,4,3]
	 NGE: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
	 stack: []

	 2,
	 stack: [2]

	 1,
	 stack: [1,2]

	 4,
	 > top
	 NGE: [4,4,-1,-1]
	 stack: [4]

	 3,
	 stack: [3,4]
	 NGE: [4,4,-1,-1]
