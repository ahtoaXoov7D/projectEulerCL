class TopologicalSorter(object):
	'''
	Get a topological sort order of vertices given a DAG
	u -> v indicates u then v
	Returns a stack containing the ordering

	Run DFS on the DAG, add a node to the stack when all its neighbors are visited.
	The topological ordering is the reverse of the order in which the nodes are added, => a stack is used

	e.g.,
            /-> c 
      a -> b    â†‘  
            \-> d

    DFS: a -> b -> c {add c}
        topological ordering: {c}
    DFS: a -> b -> d {add d}
        topological ordering: {c, d}
    DFS: a -> b  {add b}
        topological ordering: {c, d, b}
    DFS: a  {add a}
        topological ordering: {c, d, b, a}

    reverse(nodes in topological ordering) to get the actual topological ordering: {a, b, d, c}
