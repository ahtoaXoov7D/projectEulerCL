'''
A Queue which supports min() in O(1) 
in addition to the exisitng enqueue() and dequeue()

min(): returns the current minimum in the stack

Approach:
 Either enqueue() or dequeue() takes a hit to support O(1) min.

 Uses two concepts
  1. Stack with minimum
     Stack with minimum() is simpler because there is a 'recency bias'
     push (data, current minima) to the stack instead of just data.
     minimum() -> stack top

	+ push(3)
	  Stack: (3,3)

	+ push(2)
	  Stack: (2,2) (3,3)
     
	+ minimum() -> returns 2

	+ push(1)
	  Stack: (1,1) (2,2) (3,3)

	+ minimum() -> returns 1

	+ pop() -> removes 1
	  Stack: (2,2) (3,3)

	+ minimum() -> returns 2

  2. Queue implemented using 2 stacks
	 Enqueue() -> always push to S1
	 Dequeue() -> always pop from S2, unless S2 is empty, in which case, push everything from S1 to S2 and then pop from S2

	+ Enqueue(1)
	  S1: 1
	  S2:

	 + Enqueue(2)
	   S1: 2 1
	   S2:

	 + Enqueue(3)
	   S1: 3 2 1
	   S2: 

	 + Enqueue(4)
	   S1: 4 3 2 1
	   S2:

	 + Dequeue() -> should return 1
	   S1: 
	   S2: 1 2 3 4    -> pop(S2) -> 2 3 4

	 + Enqueue(5)
	   S1: 5
	   S2: 2 3 4

	 + Enqueue(6)
	   S1: 6 5
	   S2: 2 3 4

	 + Dequeue()  -> returns 2
	   S1: 6 5
	   S2: 2 3 4 -> 3 4

	 + Dequeue() -> returns 3
	   S1: 6 5
	   S2: 3 4 -> 4

	 + Dequeue() -> returns 4
	   S1: 6 5
	   S2: 4 -> []

	 + Dequeue() -> returns 5
	   S1: 6 5 (push all to S2)
	   S2:
	   =>
	   S1:
	   S2: 5 6 -> pop(S2) -> 6

	 + Dequeue() -> returns 6
	   S1:
	   S2: 6 -> pop(6) -> []
	   =>
	   S1:
	   S2:


   3. Use 1. and 2. to implement Queue with minimum
	  Uses two stacks with minimum, S1, and S2
	  NOTE: S1 can be a regular stack with an additional external state maintaining S1's min at any given time.
			S1's minimum snapshots are not used since they are all popped at once into S2 where the minimums are updated 
			for the queue-order.
			However, Using StackMin for both S1 and S2 is more consistent (symmetric?), plus S1 min is maintaned internally at S1 
			without needing to update manually


	  + Enqueue(): 
		pushes items to S1 

	  + Dequeue(): 
		Pops from S2 if not empty, 
		Else pop()  all (only items, not minimum snapshots) from S1 into S2(which maintains minima) and pop from S2
		(The minimum snapshots from S1 are not needed while moving into S2 because they will not be relevant anymore)

	  + minimum(): min(s1.minimum(), S2.minimum())

	  + Enqueue(5)
	    S1: (5,5)
	    S1.min: 5
	    S2:
		S2.min:

	  + Enqueue(4)
	    S1: (4,4) (5,5)
	    S1.min: 4
	    S2:
	    S2.min: 

	  + Enqueue(3)
	    S1: (3,3) (4,4) (5,5)
	    S1.min: 3
	    S2:
		S2.min:

	  + minimum(): S1.minimum() == 3

	  + Dequeue() -> should return 5
	    S1: => push everything from S1 to S2, and flush s1_min
	    S2:
	    =>
	    S1: 
	    S1.min: 
	    S2: (5,3) (4,3) (3,3) 
		S2.min: 3
		=> pop(S2) -> (4,3) (3,3)
		S2.min: 3

	  + minimum(): S2.minimum() == 3

	  + Enqueue(2)
	    S1: (2,2)
	    S1.min: 2
	    S2: (4,3) (3,3)
		S2.min: 3

	  + minimum(): min(S1.minimum(), S2.minimum()) == min(2, 3) == 2


	  + Dequeue() -> should return 4
	    S1: (2,2)
	    S1.min: 2
	    S2: (3,3)
		S2.min: 3

	  + Dequeue() -> should return 3
	    S1: (2,2)
	    S1.min: 2
	    S2: 
		S2.min:

	  + minimum(): S1.minimum() == 2

	  + Dequeue() -> should return 2
	    S1: (push all to S2)
	    =>
	    S1:
	    S1.min:
