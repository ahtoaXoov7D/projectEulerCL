Two paper planes are thrown upwards simultaneously. You are provided with the following data:

The flight time of both planes is denoted by 
t
t (seconds).
The initial coordinates of the first plane are denoted by (
b
bx, 
b
by, 
b
bz).
The initial velocity of the first plane is denoted by (
b
v
bvx, 
b
v
bvy, 
b
v
bvz).
The initial coordinates of the second plane are denoted by (
m
mx, 
m
my, 
m
mz).
The initial velocity of the second plane is denoted by (
m
v
mvx, 
m
v
mvy, 
m
v
mvz).
Write a program to find the minimum distance between the two planes during their flight. Let the jury answer be 
A
A and let your answer be 
B
B. Your answer will be considered correct if
