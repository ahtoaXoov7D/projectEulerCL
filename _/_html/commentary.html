As the question notes, it would be difficult to evaluate these exponents directly as they contain
over three million digits each. Therefore, we must find a way to reduce these exponents to a
manageable size.

To do so, we use the identity $\log{a^x} = x \times \log{a}$. Since $\log{b} \gt \log{a}$ if $ b \gt a$,
this will serve as an approximation of calculating the exponents directly.
