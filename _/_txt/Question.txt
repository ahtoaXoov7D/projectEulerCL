A country 
X
X consists of 
N
N cities numbered 
0
0 through 
N
-
1
N-1. The map of this country can be represented as a cycle — for each valid 
i
i, city 
i
i has exactly two neighboring cities 
(
i
+
1
)
%
N
(i+1)%N and 
(
i
-
1
+
N
)
%
N
(i-1+N)%N.

The cities in the country are broadly categorized into different types. For each valid 
i
i, the type of city 
i
i is denoted by 
A
i
Ai.

A person called Suarez wants to travel between some pairs of the cities. You are given 
Q
Q queries. In each query, Suarez wants to travel from city number 
Y
Y to a city of type 
Z
Z. Also, he wants to travel only in a given direction along the cycle.

The direction is represented by a letter — L or R. If it's L, Suarez may only move from city 
i
i to city 
(
i
-
1
+
N
)
%
N
(i-1+N)%N for each valid 
i
i. If it's R, he may only move from city 
i
i to city 
(
i
+
1
)
%
N
(i+1)%N.

You need to find the minimum number of steps Suarez needs to take to reach a city of type 
Z
Z if he starts moving from city 
Y
Y in the given direction (he can take zero steps). In one step, Suarez can move from his current city to a neighboring city.

If Suarez can never reach a city of type 
Z
Z for a given query, print 
-
1
-1 instead.

Input format

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers 
N
N and 
Q
Q. The next line contains 
N
N space-separated integers, where the 
i
i-th of these integers represents 
A
i
Ai.

Each of the following 
Q
Q lines describes a query in the format 
Y
 
Z
 
D
Y Z D, where 
Y
Y is an integer denoting the number of the starting city, 
Z
Z is an integer denoting the type of a target city and 
D
D is a letter ('L' or 'R') denoting the direction along the cycle.

Output format

For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the query.

Explanation
For the first query, Suarez is already standing in a city of the required type, hence 
0
0 steps taken.

For the second query, Suarez will take the path 1 -> 0 -> 2, hence 
2
2 steps taken.

For the third query, Suarez will take the path 2 -> 0, hence 
1
1 step taken.

For the fourth query, there is no city of type 
5
5, so the answer is 
-
1
-1.
