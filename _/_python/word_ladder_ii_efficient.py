* Problem
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
Note:

Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example 1:
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]

Example 2:
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

Solution Outline:
	0. Let A: starting word, B: ending word, C: wordlist/dictionary
	1. Build a graph starting from 'A', the starting word, s.t the word at each level is one-letter different from the previous level.
	2. Do a BFS traversal from 'A', the starting word until we reach 'B' the end word, recording 'prefix' of the current path along the way.
		To find all the minimum-length transformation paths from A to B,
		Re-purpose visited[] table as a levels+visited lookup.
		visited[word] =  level => indicates 'word' was visited at 'level' steps away from starting word.
		Add 'neighbor' to the BFS queue only if its not already visited or its level is going to be the same.
		This ensures, 
			i.  We don't add paths that exceed minimum-length
			ii. All the minimum-length paths are added

		for e.g., Consider the graph below, S: starting word, E: ending word
           S
        /  |  \       
       a   b   c
        \  |  /
           d
           |
           E

		we need 'd' to be added thrice for [S, a, d, E], [S, b, d, E], [S, c, d, E]
	3. Once we find the endWord using BFS for the first time, its recorded visited[] level stores the minimum steps needed to get to end word from start.
		We can return as soon as this level is processed.

	To build the graph,
	  Build a lookup table, of words A, B, and each word in C, and their neighbors.
	  neighbors of word, w: words that are one-letter distance away from w
	  Let word w: {w1,w2,..wn}
		  Breakup word into 'n' parts, like below, and add 'word' into each of these 'n' parts as keys.
		  {_, w2, .., wn}: word
		  {w1, _, .., wn}: word
		  .  .  .  .  .
		  {w1, w2, .., _}: word

	  After processing all words,
	  Then, for each word, w,
		its 'neighbors' are the combination of values at keys:
			{_, w2, .., wn}
			{w1, _, .., wn}
			.  .  .  .  .
			{w1, w2, .., _}

	For.e,g, A: "hit", B: "cog", C: ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]
	  "hit"
		"_it": ["hit"]
		"h_t": ["hit"]
		"hi_": ["hit"]
	  "hot":
		"_ot": ["hot"]
		"h_t": ["hit", "hot"]
		"ho_": ["hot"]
	  "dot"
		"_ot": ["hot", "dot"]
		"d_t": ["dot"]
		"do_": ["dot"]
	  "dog":
		"_og": ["dog"]
		"d_g": ["dog"]
		"do_": ["dot", "dog"]
	  "lot"
		"_ot": ["hot", "dot", "lot"]
		"l_t": ["lot"]
		"lo_": ["lot"]
	  "log"
		"_og": ["dog", "log"]
		"l_g": ["log"]
		"lo_": ["lot", "log"]
	  "cog"
		"_og": ["dog", "log", "cog"]
		"c_g": ["cog"]
		"co_": ["cog"]

	Now use the lookup table as the graph, to get neighbors of each word, and perform a BFS, starting from 'A',
	until we reach 'B', while recording the number of levels

	Q: [("hit", [])]
	visited: 
		{"hit": 1}

	Found 'cog' at level 5

	Minimum level ==  (4+1) == 5
	=> None of our paths should exceed 5 words from "hit" to "cog"

	Dequeue: ("log", {"hit", "hot", "lot"})
	Q: [("cog", {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog"})]
    hit
      \

	neighbor of "log": lookup["_og"] + lookup["l_g"] + lookup["lo_"]
					 : ["dog", "log", "cog"] + ["log"] + ["lot", "log"] {remove visited}
					 : ["cog"]

	"cog" is already visited at level 5, this enqueue will also put it at level 5
	Add "cog" to queue
	Q: [("cog", {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog"}), ("cog", {"hit", "hot", "lot", "log"})]
	visited: 
		{
		 "hit": 1,
		 "hot": 2,
		 "dot": 3,
		 "lot": 3,
		 "dog": 4,
		 "log": 4,
		 "cog": 5
		}

	Dequeue: ("cog", {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog"})
	found endword
		Add to solution: {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "cog"}
    hit
      \ 
        - - hot
              \    / - dot -- dog -- cog
                - -
                   \ - lot -- log


	Dequeue: ("cog", {"hit", "hot", "lot", "log"})
	found endword
		Add to solution: {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "cog"}
						 {"hit", "hot", "lot", "log", "cog"}
    hit
      \ 
        - - hot
              \    / - dot -- dog -- \
                - -                  cog
                   \ - lot -- log -- /


  At this point if there were additional levels in the queue, we return as even if they lead to 'cog', they exceed minimum length.
