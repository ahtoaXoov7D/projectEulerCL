Find the pivot of rotation (also the minimum element) in a rotated sorted array

Solution outline: O(log n)-ish
-----------------------------
O(n) if the number of repititions are ~n

find_pivot:
	l = 0, h=n-1
	split at mid = (l+h)/2
	check a[0..mid] contains pivot or a[mid..h] contains the pivot
	  {A subarray a[x..y] contains the pivot if a[x] > a[y] (x<y)}
	Upon determining a subarray a[x..y] that contains the pivot, mark 'y' as a potential
	  and check a[x..y-1] again


Sample run 1:
	A: [4,5,6,1,2,3]

	l: 0, h: 5
	mid: 2
	A[0] == 4 > A[5] == 3 => rotated
	  A[mid] = 6 > A[h] => pivot is in the right half, [6,1,2,3]
	  pivot could be 3 (index: 5)
	
	l: 3, h: 5
	mid: 4
	A[3] == 1 > A[5] == 3  => subarray [1,2,3] no longer rotated
	pivot = min(pivot, 1) == min(3, 1) == 1 (index: 3)
	we are done here


Sample run 2:
  A: [4,5,1,2,3]

  l: 0, h: 4
  mid: 2
  A[0] == 4 > A[4] == 3 => rotated
    A[mid] == 1 < A[l] == 4 => pivot is in the left half, [4,5,1]
	pivot candidate: 1

  l: 0, h: 1
  mid: 1
  A[0] == 4 > A[1] == 5 => no longer rotated
  pivot = min(4, pivot) == min(4, 1) == 1
  return 1


Sample run 3:
  A: [4,5,6,7,1,2]
  
  l: 0, h: 5
  mid: 2
  A[0] == 4 > A[5] == 2  => rotated
    A[mid] == 6 > A[h] == 2 => pivot is in the right half, [6,7,1,2]
	pivot candidate: 2

  l: 3, h: 5, [7,1,2]
  mid: 4
  A[l] == 7 > A[h] == 2  => rotated
    A[l == 7 > A[mid] == 1 => pivot is in the lef half, [7,1]
