* Problem
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
Note:

Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example 1:
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Example 2:
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.


* Solution description
  + minlevel = ∞
  + Start with constructing a Directing Acyclic graph with Ws (= starting word) as starting vertex.
  + Add links from any word, Wj to word, Wi if Wj is one transformation away from Wi, in a breadth-first manner.
    - capture level, which is the distance of the current node representing Wx from Ws.
    - Add each word except We (= end word) exactly once into the DAG.
    - Since each outgoing edge from any vertex for Wi represents its parent, all the way to Ws,
      if we find We, simply retrace the path all the way back to Ws to get all the words involved in the transformation.
  + Once We is found, and its level < minlevel, trace back all parent links until Ws.
    + Continue search for next We as long level == minlevel.

Lookup table to get one-letter transforms of any given word in list

words: MALE, MAKE, MIKE, PALE
u create lookup table initially like so
MALE:
  [*ALE]: {MALE}
  [M*LE]: {MALE}
  [MA*E]: {MALE}
  [MAL*]: {MALE}
MAKE:
  [*AKE]: {MAKE}
  [M*KE]: {MAKE}

  [MIK*]: {MIKE}
PALE:
  [*ALE]: {MALE, PALE}
  [P*LE]: {PALE}
  [PA*E]: {PALE}
  [PAL*]: {PALE}

Final lookup table:
  [M*LE]: {MALE}
