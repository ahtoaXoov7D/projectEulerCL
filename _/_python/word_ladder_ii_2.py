* Problem
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
Note:

Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example 1:
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]

Example 2:
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.


* Solution description
  =====================
  + minlevel = ∞
  + Start with constructing a Directing Acyclic graph with Ws (= starting word) as starting vertex.
  + Add links from any word, Wj to word, Wi if Wj is one transformation away from Wi, in a breadth-first manner.
    - capture level, which is the distance of the current node representing Wx from Ws.
    - Add an edge from Wj to Wi only if Wi can be tranformed into Wj with a one-letter change.
      - Since we also capture level information for a vertex, a vertex can have many outgoing links to multiple parents
      - as long as the level remains intact.
	- this automatically prevents edges between two vertices in the same level.
           eg.
                  W1
               /      \
              w2  -   w3  (is not allowed) since w3 is also at level 1, adding edge from w3-w1 will make it level 2, and therefore not allowed)

        - also back edges w1-w2 and w2-w1 will be avoided, because w1-w2 puts w2 at level 1, w1 at level 0, w2-w1 will put w2 and w1 and different levels.

	- and more importantly, it allows 'diamond' pattern like below -

	     w1
       /    \
      w2     w3
       \     /
          w4

            Here w4 is firmly at level 2, but has two outgoing links to w2, and w3.

    - Since each outgoing edge from any vertex for Wi represents its parent, all the way to Ws,
      if we find We, Simply do a DFS to extract all paths from We to Ws.

  + Once We is found, and its level < minlevel, trace back all parent links until Ws.
    + Continue search for next We as long level == minlevel.

We: "tax"
