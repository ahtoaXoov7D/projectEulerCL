Merge Intervals

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:
	Given intervals [1,3],[6,9] insert and merge [2,5] would result in [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
	Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] would result in [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].
	This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

Make sure the returned intervals are also sorted.

Solution Outline: Strictly O(n) time, O(n) space
   NOTE: Previous solution using in-place insert/remove in an array/list might be O(nÂ²)
	0. A: sorted array of intervals, (x,y): interval to be inserted
	1. Use a list-based stack, 
	2. Scan the array, A, Left-Right, add them into the stack until we find (a,b) s.t x > a
	   At this point,
	     . . . (a,b), (x,y), (i,j), ...
		 a < x, x < i
	3. If y is between (a,b) no need to add (x,y), however reduce (a,b),..., till we can no longer merge intervals
	4. Otherwise, 
	    Change (a,b) to (a, max(b, y)), then reduce from here.
	5. Return the list/stack


Sample run:
	A: [1,2], [3,5], [6,7]. [8,10], [12,16]
	n: [4,9]

	Stack: []

	interval: [1,2]
	stack: [1,2]

	interval: [3,5]
	stack: [1,2], [3,5]

	interval: [6,7] > [4,9]
	stack top: [3,5] vs [4,9] -> merge === [3,9]
	stack: [1,2], [3,9]

	interval: [6,7]
	stack top: [3,9] vs [6,7] -> merge == [3,9]

	interval: [8,10]
	stack top: [3,9] vs [8,10] -> merge == [3,10]
	stack: [1,2], [3,10]

	interval: [12, 16], 12 > 9, copy everything as-is from here
	stack: [1,2], [3,10], [12,16]
