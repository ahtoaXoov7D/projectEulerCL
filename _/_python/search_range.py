Search for a Range

Given a sorted array of integers A(0 based index) of size N, find the starting and ending position of a given integar B in array A.

Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].


Input Format
The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.

Output Format
 Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].

Constraints
 1 <= N <= 10^6
 1 <= A[i], B <= 10^9

For Example
Input 1:
    A = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
    B = 8
Output 1:
    [3, 4]
Explanation 1:
    First occurence of 8 in A is at index 3
    Second occurence of 8 in A is at index 4
    ans = [3, 4]

Input 2:
    A = [5, 17, 100, 111]
    B = 3
Output 2:
    [-1, -1]

Solution Outline: O(logn)
	1. Find thr first match, idx, for key in A
	2. Find leftmost occurence, l,  of key in A[0:idx]
	3. Find rightmost occurence, r,  of key in A[idx:n-1]
	4: Return [l, r]
