'''
There are N+1 parking spots, numbered from 0 to N. 
There are N cars numbered from 1 to N parked in various parking spots with one left empty. 
Reorder the cars so that car #1 is in spot #1, car #2 is in spot #2 and so on. 
Spot #0 will remain empty => There is no car #0. 
The only allowed operation is to take a car and move it to the free spot.
'''


'''
Linear solution: (Needs atmost 2*n car moves)
	Have empty slots move from right to left until slot 0
	Start at rightmost slot, move the car{i} there to the current empty slot.
	This leaves slot{n} as the empty slot. Move car{n} to slot{n}.
	Repeat with {n-1}, ... 0
	At slot 1, we are done
