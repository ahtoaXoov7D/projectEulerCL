Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
The flattened tree should look like:

1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6

	Flatten a Binary Tree into a singly linked list in-place such that the SLL has nodes in the preorder traversal of the binary tree

	Algorithm:
		1. Recursively convert left and right subtrees to SLLs, each with their own head and tail.
		2. Merge the left and right SLLs, left followed by right
		3. Insert root to the left of the merged SLL
		   (lh, lt): represents left subtree's head and tail nodes
		   (rh, rt): represents right subtree's head and tail nodes
		   the new merged SLL will look like
		   root, lh ... lt, rh, ... rt
		   (lh, rt) will be the head and tail of the merged SLL
		3. A leaf node's SLL (head, tail) will be itself
		NOTE: Unlike inorder, the left of the root in a subtree will need to be sanitized because its left will not be changed by the merges.
		      e.g., 
			    1
			  /   \
			 2     3

			 == 2 <- 1 -> 3
			 left SLL would be [2], right SLL would be [3]
			 Merged left + right:  2 -> 3
			 Merging root,  <- 1 -> 2 -> 3
			                |  ------^  
			 Therefore root's left need to be set to None, resulting in 1 -> 2 -> 3
			 However, this needn't be done for each subtree, because each subtree's root eventually points back to _something_
			 Only the root of the whole tree would be left dangling at the end, creating a loop, and needs to be sanitized.
