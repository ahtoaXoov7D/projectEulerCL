Word Ladder I

Given two words A and B, and a dictionary, C, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from A to B, such that:
	You must change exactly one character in every transformation.
	Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.

Note:
	Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
	All words have the same length.
	All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.


Input Format:
	The first argument of input contains a string, A.
	The second argument of input contains a string, B.
	The third argument of input contains an array of strings, C.

Output Format:
Return an integer representing the minimum number of steps required to change string A to string B.

Constraints:
1 <= length(A), length(B), length(C[i]) <= 25
1 <= length(C) <= 5e3

Example :
Input 1:
    A = "hit"
    B = "cog"
    C = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]

Output 1:
    5

Explanation 1:
    "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"

Solution Outline:
	1. Build a graph starting from 'A', the starting word, s.t the word at each level is one-letter different from the previous level.
	2. Do a BFS traversal from 'A', the starting word until we reach 'B' the end word.
		Calculate the path length - this will be the minimum number of steps needed to change from A to B.

	To build the graph,
	  Build a lookup table, of words A, B, and each word in C, and their neighbors.
	  neighbors of word, w: words that are one-letter distance away from w
	  Let word w: {w1,w2,..wn}
		  Breakup word into 'n' parts, like below, and add 'word' into each of these 'n' parts as keys.
		  {_, w2, .., wn}: word
		  {w1, _, .., wn}: word
		  .  .  .  .  .
		  {w1, w2, .., _}: word

	  After processing all words,
	  Then, for each word, w,
		its 'neighbors' are the combination of values at keys:
			{_, w2, .., wn}
			{w1, _, .., wn}
			.  .  .  .  .
			{w1, w2, .., _}

	For.e,g, A: "hit", B: "cog", C: ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]
	  "hit"
		"_it": ["hit"]
		"h_t": ["hit"]
		"hi_": ["hit"]
	  "hot":
		"_ot": ["hot"]
		"h_t": ["hit", "hot"]
		"ho_": ["hot"]
	  "dot"
		"_ot": ["hot", "dot"]
		"d_t": ["dot"]
		"do_": ["dot"]
	  "dog":
		"_og": ["dog"]
		"d_g": ["dog"]
		"do_": ["dot", "dog"]
	  "lot"
		"_ot": ["hot", "dot", "lot"]
		"l_t": ["lot"]
		"lo_": ["lot"]
	  "log"
		"_og": ["dog", "log"]
		"l_g": ["log"]
		"lo_": ["lot", "log"]
	  "cog"
		"_og": ["dog", "log", "cog"]
		"c_g": ["cog"]
		"co_": ["cog"]

	Now use the lookup table as the graph, to get neighbors of each word, and perform a BFS, starting from 'A',
	until we reach 'B', while recording the number of levels
