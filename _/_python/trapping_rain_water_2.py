Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

       _      | |_   _
   _  | |W W W| | |W| |_
 _|_|W|_|_|W|_|_|_|_|_|_|

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (W) are being trapped.

Example:
	Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
	Output: 6

               _

[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

Solution Outline: O(nh), h: max bar height, n: number of bars
	Think of the bars as a 2d matrix of blocks, a full column representing a bar, individual rows representing number of bars.
	Each cell (i,j) in the matrix is either 1 if the bar i has enough height j, 0 otherwise.
	So [2,1,2] represents a matrix of 2x3 like below
	1 0 1
	1 1 1

	Visually:
     _   _
    | |_| |
    |_|_|_|
	
	With such a representation, water filling the gaps can be simulated line-by-line bottom-up (think a line-printer going bottom to up)
	Count all the 'empty' slots in between, ignore all trailing and leading slots (as these cannot hold water)

	NOTE: We don't actually need to create a grid representing the matrix of 1s and 0s,
		  Just decrement bar height at every level, -ve values means gaps
