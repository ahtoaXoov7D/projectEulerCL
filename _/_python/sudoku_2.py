Sudoku

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
Empty cells are indicated by the character '.'
You may assume that there will be only one unique solution.

and its solution numbers marked in red.

Example :
For the above given diagrams, the corresponding input to your program will be
	[[53..7....], [6..195...], [.98....6.], [8...6...3], [4..8.3..1], [7...2...6], [.6....28.], [...419..5], [....8..79]]
and we would expect your program to modify the above array of array of characters to
	[[534678912], [672195348], [198342567], [859761423], [426853791], [713924856], [961537284], [287419635], [345286179]]

Solution Outline:
	1. Scan for empty slots row-wise, left-right and fill one at a time with numbers
		that are allowed.
	2. Any time, any of 1-9 cannot be placed at a particular cell, backtrack to the previous position that was filled,
		and try to place +1 in its place, and repeat 2. until we are done with all the empty cells.
	3. As a slight optimization, each recursive call need not scan for empty slots from the top-left cell.
		Since we fill cells top-bottom, left-right, we can start from the last empty cell that was filled.
