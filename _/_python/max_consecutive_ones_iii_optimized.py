Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

 Example 1:
 Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
 Output: 6
 Explanation: 
 [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

 Example 2:
 Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
 Output: 10
 Explanation: 
 [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
 Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

* Solution description
Consider an arbitrary sequence:
  i: 0 . . . 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
  A:         0 1 1 1 0 1  1  1  0  1  0  1  1  0
  k = 3
  If we are starting at 9, we can flip 3 slots containing 0s (namely 9, 13, 15)
  let 
    'start': the start of this k-slot range     [in this case, 9]
    'end':   the end of the k-slot range        [in this case, 15]

  Then A would become
    i: 0 . . . 5 6 7 8  9  10 11 12  13  14  15 16 17 18
    A:         0 1 1 1 _1_ 1  1  1  _1_  1  _1_  1  1  0

  resulting a longest 1 sequence of length 12 (for this flip of k 0s)
  This sequence has 3 parts: pre-window, window, post-window.
  The 'window' is the sequence of 1s extended/merged as a result of toggling k 0s between [start .. end]
  pre-window: is the number of 1s between 'start', and a 0 slot to the left of 'start'.
  post-window: is the number of 1s after 'end', and a 0 slot to the right of 'end'.

  In the example, start = 9, end = 15,
  window = number of 1s between 15 and 9 (including 9 and 15) == 15-9+1 == 7  
    i:  9  10 11 12  13  14  15
    A: _1_ 1  1  1  _1_  1  _1_

  pre-window = number of 1s between 9 and 5 (excluding both 9 and 5, 5 is the 0 slot to the left of 'start') = 9-5-1 = 3
    i: 5 6 7 8  9  
    A: 0 1 1 1 _1_

  post-window = number of 1s between 15 and 18 (excluding both 15 and 18, 18 is the 0 slot to the right of 'end') = 18-15-1 = 2

  Total 1s sequence as a result of flipping k(=3) 0s in this case = 
     = pre-window + window + post-window
     = 3 + 7 + 2 = 12


If we then slide over to the next k-slots, (13, 15, 18) and so on until the end
we'll have the longest 1s sequence by the end of the pass.

If 'start' is the very first 0s slot, then we use (-1) as the starting point for pre-window
 e.g.,
      i:  0  1  2  3 
      A: [1, 1, 1, 0, ....,], start = 3 
      pre-window = (3 - (-1) -1) = 3 

If 'end' is the last 0s slot, then we use (n == length(A)) as the ending point for post-window
   e.g.,
       i:           6  7  8  9         
       A: [......., 0, 1, 1, 1], 
          n = 10, end = (n-4) = 6
       post-window = (n- (n-4) -1) = (10 - 6 - 1) = 3
