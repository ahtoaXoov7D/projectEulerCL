The problem is to find {a,b,c} such that a<=b<=c and a,b,c are in order in the array

My solution is to find potential {a} before u can supplant it with another potential {a} only if the new a or a' if you will is the new minima
for e.g., 9, 2, ...
initially 9 is the minima so a=9, then u encounter 2, 2<=9, and anything 9 can do, 2 can do better (and alas since 9 is to the left of 2, it cannot be {2,9})
if 10, 11 (list = 9 2 10 11) follows for eg 9,10,11 will be a sequence, but 2,10,11 is also a inc sequence and better yet, 2 can handle {2,3,4} if 3 and 4 were to come later but {9} cannot.
so step1: find {a} as the local minima and keep trying to supplant or extend the sequence.

now at any given time, if u find an element b such that b>=a, u add it to ur sequence {a,b}
for e.g. 9,2,7
initially a = 9, b = Φ
then a = 2, b = Φ
at 7, 7>=a but also to the right, so we find a seuqnce of length 2 (potentially)
so {a,b} = {2,7}

but once u have a potential {a,b} u cannot just supplant it with another a' s.t a' < a
u need both a' < a and b' < b
for e.g.
9 2 7 1
its tempting at this point to chuck {2,7} and start at {1, Φ) but an 8 might follow meaning {2,7} was right all along
so we keep 1 as a' in the back burner and only replace {2,7} if we find say 3 next
so at 9 2 7 1 3 we replace {2,7} with {1,3} because {1,3} has better chances of findinf inc sequence than {2,7}

OR we supplant {a,b} if we find another b' st b' <= b but not <a,
for e.g., at {2,7} if we encounter 4, then we replace {2,7} with {2,4}

Then on, we just keep trying to supplant {a,b} or we are done as soon as we find an x >= b
